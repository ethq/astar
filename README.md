## astar
Implementation of A* in 3D, visualized in a voxel-like terrain rendered with three.js

## setup
- clone, npm install and npm start in the astar-app folder.

## usage
- Click on nodes with your mouse to mark them. 
- To confirm a node as a startpoint, endpoint or as an obstacle, either 1) press 'a' while marked or 2) check the auto-confirm checkbox prior to mark the node.
- If multiple nodes are marked, one will be highlighted and this node will be turned into your type of choice upon confirm.
- To cycle the highlighted node, use the left and right arrow keys.
- Hold shift to use the camera without interacting with the terrain.
